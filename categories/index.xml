      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a system administrator specializing in UNIX systems and networks for over 12 years. For the last 4 years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at an innovative hardware company that makes enterprise flash products (to be used by system administrators).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My latest role is that of Performance Engineer, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into the challenges of instrumenting at a system level, observing bottlenecks, and coming up with strategies and best practice for removing those bottlenecks. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working with the supremely smart people dedicated to our All Flash Array (AFA) product, and my aim is to help make our AFA the best in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site serves to document the things I learn along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
